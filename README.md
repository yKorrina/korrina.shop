This is the source code and files for my website. 
I made it originally in webflow and exported the code using some third party tool, knowing absolutely nothing about html.
I spent the next couple initial weeks refining the code and outlinks a little bit, learning bits and pieces of coding as I went.
I put the site into ChatGPT one day and it absolutely mogged me--that's where most of the improvement has come from since the initial launch.
Thanks
